# Coetzee Command Center - Development Rules

## Project Overview
You are building a unified business operations platform combining project management, client tracking, component documentation, and code playground features.

## Core Technologies
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Auth: NextAuth.js v4.24.13 (stable)
- State: TanStack Query + Zustand

## Critical Rules

### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types
- All components must be typed
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep files under 300 lines
- Use functional components with hooks only
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks

### Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case (project-card.tsx)
- Components: PascalCase (ProjectCard)
- Functions: camelCase (handleSubmit)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Database: snake_case

### File Organization
- Group related components in feature folders
- Co-locate hooks with components
- Keep types in separate files when shared
- Use barrel exports for cleaner imports

### Performance
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize images with next/image
- Prefer server components

### Security
- Never expose sensitive data in client
- Validate all inputs with Zod
- Use parameterized queries only
- Rate limit API routes

### Accessibility
- Keyboard accessible
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed
- WCAG AA compliance

## Documentation Location

**ALL documentation is in the `documentation/` folder:**

- **Design System:** `documentation/design/design-system.md` - Colors, typography, spacing, component patterns
- **Architecture:** `documentation/architecture/architecture.md` - Folder structure, data flow, patterns
- **Database:** `documentation/architecture/database-schema.md` - Prisma schema and query examples
- **API Conventions:** `documentation/architecture/api-conventions.md` - API route standards
- **Common Tasks:** `documentation/development/common-tasks.md` - Frequently used commands
- **Roadmap:** `documentation/development/roadmap.md` - Development timeline

**Current Phase:** Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-12)
See `documentation/development/roadmap.md` for detailed timeline.

## Before Committing

## Automatic Documentation

**User Commands for Documentation:**
- `doc` → End of each day: Update today's progress in `documentation/development/daily-log.md`
- `📊 week [N]` → End of each week (Friday): Weekly summary, update `documentation/development/roadmap.md`
- `📝 Decision: [title]` → After major decisions: Log in `documentation/decisions/decisions.md`
- `✅ [task-name]` → After completing tasks: Mark complete in `documentation/development/roadmap.md`

**IMPORTANT: All documentation files must go in `documentation/` folder with proper subfolders:**
- `documentation/architecture/` - Architecture, database, API docs
- `documentation/development/` - Roadmap, daily log, common tasks
- `documentation/decisions/` - Architectural decisions
- `documentation/design/` - Design system, component patterns
- `documentation/guides/` - How-to guides

**Proactive Documentation:**
- After every feature completion: Update roadmap, mark tasks complete
- When making architectural decisions: Log in decision log immediately
- Proactively suggest documentation updates when appropriate
- Keep decision log current
- Track progress percentages automatically

After completing any feature, you MUST:
1. Update roadmap automatically
2. Mark completed tasks with [x]
3. Update progress percentages
4. Log architectural decisions

### 2. **Use Short Prompts**

Instead of long explanations, just say:
- `"doc"` - Update everything relevant
- `"✅ project-card"` - Mark that task done
- `"📝 Decision: using React Query because better devtools"` - Quick decision log
- `"📊 week 3"` - Weekly review

### 3. **Weekly Habit** (Every Sunday)
```
"Weekly review for week [N]:
Completed: [list what you finished]
In progress: [what's 50%+ done]
Decisions: [any major choices]
Update all documentation"


## Documentation System
See `documentation/guides/documentation-system.md` for automatic documentation rules.
Follow those rules throughout our conversation.


## Special Commands

When I say:
- "doc" → Update all relevant documentation for what we just did
- "✅" → Mark last completed task in roadmap
- "📝" → Add last decision to decision log  
- "📊" → Weekly review and update
- "🔍" → Check what documentation needs updating
